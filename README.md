# CEDI - Cube EDItor
### ⚠️Currently WIP⚠️


## The gimmick

Currently, the idea is to write just a simple text editor that can switch files with animation of a cube rotating.
It will not have only 6 files possible to open though! Actually it will progress more like an *infinite* labyrinth.


## Progress
- [x] Rendering something
- [ ] Rendering actual characters (only ASCII though?)
- [ ] Rendering files contents
- [ ] Editing the file
- [ ] Rotation animation
- [ ] Multiple files opened


## Possible future features
* Having multiple cubes to switch. Kinda like virtual workspaces!
